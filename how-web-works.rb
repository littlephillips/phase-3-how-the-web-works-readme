# define client and server
# define a static site vs a dynamic site
# explain what a HTTP request is
# explain the nature of request and response

#when working on the server, our goal is always:
  # :: Process a request from a client
  # :: create a response
  # :: send the response to the client


#HTTP 
  # :: Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol 

#Requests
  # :: URL - uniform resource locator
# https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-3-how-the-web-works-readme
  # :: https - the protocol , format we use to send our requests
  # :: github.com - the domain name
  # :: /learn-co-curriculum/phase-3-how-the-web-works-readme - the path

#HTTP VERB
  # :: GET - retrieves a representation of a resource
  # :: POST - create a new resource using data n the bosy of the request
  # :: PUT - update an existing resource using data in the bosy of the request
  # :: PATCH - update part of an existing resource using data in the body of the request
  # :: DELETE - delete a specific resource
  # :: HEAD - asks for a response (like GET but without the body)
  # :: Trace - echoes back the received request
  # :: OPTIONS - returns the HTTP methods the server supports
  # :: CONNECT - converts the request to a TCP/IP tunnel (generally for ssl)

#Request Format
  # :: has request headers / metadata

#Response
  # :: separated into headers & the body
  # :: :: Headers
  # :: :: :: request method
  # :: :: :: status code
  # :: :: :: etcetra || metadata of the repsonse
  # :: :: Body 
  # :: :: :: HTML/CSS
